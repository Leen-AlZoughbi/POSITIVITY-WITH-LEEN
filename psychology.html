                   Those who practice positive psychology attempt psychological interventions that foster positive attitudes toward one's subjective experiences, individual traits, and life events. The goal is to minimize pathological thoughts that may arise in a hopeless mindset, and to, instead, develop sense of optimism toward life.

              The positive psychology movement aims to improve individuals and populations with greater social and economic outcomes through a focus on psychological factors that promote personal growth. It is used in a variety of contexts, including educational settings, health care, criminal justice, employment, criminal rehabilitation, and women's studies. Positive psychology also has been used to promote many types of sports, such as swimming, volleyball, and football.The Positive Psychology Network has become an international organization to promote, facilitate, and disseminate research, applications, resources, and support for the psychology of the positive.

                  Psychology began in the study of psychiatry, the study of mental illnesses. The study of a healthy human being was an initial goal of psychologists, who wished to learn what psychological disturbances were common in humans and how best to treat them. The field of psychology was limited to this narrower realm until the works of Sigmund Freud, Max.
Be always hopeful, for it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. William James, "The Will to Believe"<br>
Be always positive, for a negative state is as damaging as a positive one; he who is always positive is healthy as he who is always negative. Charles S. Peirce, "Condensed Logic"<br>
Remember that we live once only and life is the most beautiful of experiences. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self Reliance
